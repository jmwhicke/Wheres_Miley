Wheres_Miley
============
By Jorden Whicker, Kevin Fladell, and Andy Hoch

	Designed for the iPhone 4 (3.5').

	This is our interactive "Where's Miley application." Where users can choose 'levels' and search for the image of Miley Cyrus. This is similar to the "Where's Waldo" game we all played growing up.

	Be aware that each level is timed according to its difficulty. An alert will appear when your time is up and you will be forced to return to the 'levels' screen. The good thing is you don't lose a life nor will you have to restart the game. 

	Note that these are the necessary frameworks if you are attempting to clone our source code:

		AVFoundation
		Foundation
		CoreGraphics
		UIKit
		XCTest

	Functions that SHOULD be working...

		1. # of lives for each level (3).
		2. timer for each level (30-60 seconds).
		3. Save unlocked levels after exiting.
		4. loops through music on the home-screen.
		5. alert the user when time is up and when the # of lives have all been used.
